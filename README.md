# Calculator

Hello guys,
My name is Shashank Tripathi.
I created the following project
It includes a calculator that can do basic operations such as addition,substraction,multiplication,division.


If you want to run this code:-
1.Just create a new folder with a file named as Calculator and save the code in it

2. Compile `Calculator.java` with `javac Calculator.java`

3. Then run `java Calculator` to launch the Calculator.

This program is compatible with any verion of java above JAVA 1.7.5
